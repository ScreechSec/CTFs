# Incident Lifecycle CTF

## Overview

Welcome to the **Incident Lifecycle CTF**! This Capture the Flag challenge is designed for novice beginners to simulate the real-world lifecycle of a cybersecurity incident. Participants will step into the role of a security analyst, investigating an attack and responding to it through seven critical stages of incident response.

This CTF was created to be educational, fun, and interactive, providing hands-on experience with realistic scenarios. The challenge content and guidance were crafted with the help of **ChatGPT**.

## Challenge Stages

### 1. **Initial Access**
Analyze web server logs to identify how the attacker gained initial access to the system. This stage introduces common web-based attack techniques, such as SQL injection.

### 2. **Evasive Maneuvers**
Examine system logs to detect how the attacker covered their tracks, including log deletion and privilege escalation.

### 3. **Persistence**
Investigate how the attacker ensured long-term access to the system by analyzing user accounts, startup scripts, and other persistence mechanisms.

### 4. **Identification**
Dive into network and endpoint logs to uncover the attackerâ€™s activities, including command-and-control (C2) communication and reconnaissance.

### 5. **Containment**
Create rules for endpoint security, firewall configurations, and intrusion detection systems to block the attackerâ€™s activities and prevent further damage.

### 6. **Eradication**
Remove all remnants of the attackerâ€™s activity, including malicious users, files, and backdoors.

### 7. **Remediation**
Propose a remediation plan to secure the system and prevent future attacks by addressing vulnerabilities, improving monitoring, and strengthening defenses.
