### Challenge for Participants

Provide participants with the context of the attack and ask them to create a **Remediation Plan** to secure the system. Here’s the challenge description:

---

#### Challenge Description

The system was compromised through an SQL injection attack, which led to a reverse shell and the creation of a persistent backdoor. You have eradicated the attacker’s artifacts, including malicious users, files, and startup scripts.

Now, your task is to recommend specific remediation steps to:
1. Secure the system against similar attacks in the future.
2. Improve the organization’s monitoring and response capabilities.
3. Address any vulnerabilities exploited in this incident.

Submit your remediation plan as a text file.

**Hints:**
- Consider steps for system hardening, monitoring, and access control.
- Suggest specific tools or configurations to mitigate vulnerabilities.
