Incident Lifecycle CTF

Overview
Welcome to the Incident Lifecycle CTF! This Capture the Flag challenge is designed to simulate the real-world lifecycle of a cybersecurity incident. Participants will step into the shoes of a security analyst, uncovering the details of an attack, responding to threats, and remediating the system to prevent future incidents.

This CTF is a hands-on learning experience that covers every step of an incident response process, from Initial Access to Remediation. Each stage presents unique challenges, complete with realistic logs, scripts, and configurations for you to analyze.

Through this CTF, you will:

Understand the lifecycle of an incident response process.
Practice identifying malicious activities in web access logs, syslogs, and endpoint logs.
Gain experience writing containment rules for Snort, firewalls, and endpoint security tools.
Develop skills in analyzing persistence mechanisms and crafting remediation plans.
Simulate a hands-on response to a complex cybersecurity attack.
Challenge Stages

The CTF is divided into seven stages, each representing a phase in the incident lifecycle:

Initial Access: Identify how the attacker gained access.

Analyze web server logs for suspicious requests.
Evasive Maneuver: Discover how the attacker attempted to cover their tracks.

Examine system logs for missing entries or anomalies.
Persistence: Uncover how the attacker maintained access to the system.

Investigate user accounts and startup scripts for backdoors.
Identification: Analyze network and endpoint logs to identify malicious activity.

Identify attacker IPs, tools, and methods of lateral movement.
Containment: Create security rules to block malicious activity.

Write Snort, firewall, and endpoint rules to contain the attack.
Eradication: Remove malicious artifacts from the system.

Identify and delete malicious files or processes.
Remediation: Plan long-term improvements to prevent future incidents.

Propose hardening measures, monitoring tools, and best practices.
Each stage has its own folder containing the challenge files and instructions.

To complete a challenge:

Extract the flag by solving the challenge.
Submit the flag in the corresponding stage folder or in your write-up.
